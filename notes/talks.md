### Building a benchmarking tool for reproducible research

The talk will be about the project I'm currently working and also the topic for my bachelor thesis. I'm building a benchmarking tool to help researchers, especially in the field of computational science, with the common task of benchmarking and analysis. The tool will allow researchers to easily setup, share, extend, and reproduce benchmarks with minimum effort, in the hope that these will lessen the barrier to reproducible research.
