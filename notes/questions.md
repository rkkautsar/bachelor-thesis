- besides the client/server, is the whole architecture okay?
- client/server
  - should the sqlite be mandatory? or should we support other db?
- ~~evaluation phase — still no idea; there's papermill for parameterized python notebooks~~
  - ~~should we just focus on the runs?~~
- should we use git to track source code? then store the current HEAD to database for each run? — add timestamp too
- executors / resource limiter: currently only `psmon`
  - runsolver
- cross platform? i.e. windows support? currently with `psmon` we can support both linux and mac os — reprozip, for example, supports windows — maybe no
- task sources: should we add more? — ok for now
- tool support: currently only simple executable — nice to have
- what strength should we emphasize for this project?
  - extensibility?
  - reproducibility?
  - sharing?
