	Benchmarking is one popular way to conduct experiments, especially in the field of computational science.
	It provides a systematic, easily reproducible framework to compare performance between implementations.
	Benchmarking tool uses resource monitoring tool to measure the performance of selected implementations to selected test instances.
	We review the existing benchmarking tools and found none of them meet our requirements of an ideal benchmarking tool.
	We thus propose a new benchmarking tool designed for reproducible research.
	We also provide a cross-platform implementation that has been tested to run in Linux and macOS.
	Our evaluation shows that the proposed benchmarking tool fulfills most of the requirements, except for comprehensive documentation and testing.
	The proposed tool also shows potential in future development to further lower the effort to embrace reproducibility.
